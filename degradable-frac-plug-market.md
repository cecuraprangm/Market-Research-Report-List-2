<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Degradable Frac Plug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Frac Plug</li><li>Plastic Frac Plug</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Degradable frac plugs are essential tools used in hydraulic fracturing operations to isolate sections of a wellbore. There are two main types of degradable frac plugs: metal frac plugs and plastic frac plugs. Metal frac plugs are typically made of materials like aluminum or magnesium, which slowly degrade over time in the wellbore. Plastic frac plugs are made of degradable polymers that break down into smaller particles during the production process. Both types of degradable frac plugs offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional, non-degradable frac plugs.</p></p>
