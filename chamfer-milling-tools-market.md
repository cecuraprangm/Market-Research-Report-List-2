<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chamfer Milling Tools Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>90 Degree</li><li>60 Degree</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chamfer milling tools are available in various market types, including 90-degree and 60-degree options. The 90-degree chamfer milling tools provide a sharp edge with a right angle, making them suitable for creating precise and clean chamfers. On the other hand, the 60-degree chamfer milling tools offer a more gradual angle, which is ideal for softer materials or when a more gradual chamfer is required. Both types of tools are commonly used in machining processes to create beveled edges and improve the aesthetic appeal of the workpiece.</p></p>
