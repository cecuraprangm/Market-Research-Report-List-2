<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Single Stage Centrifugal Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-priming Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Non-self-priming Centrifugal Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horizontal single stage centrifugal pumps are commonly divided into two market types: self-priming and non-self-priming pumps. Self-priming centrifugal pumps are designed to create a vacuum to prime themselves without the need for external assistance, making them ideal for applications where the pump may be above the water source. Non-self-priming centrifugal pumps, on the other hand, require the pump casing to be filled with liquid before operation, making them better suited for applications where the pump is located below the water source.</p></p>
