<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Containment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Aisle Thermal Containment</li><li>Hot Aisle Thermal Containment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal containment systems are essential for effective data center cooling management. Cold aisle thermal containment involves enclosing the cold aisle with barriers to prevent hot air from mixing with the cool air, improving overall cooling efficiency. On the other hand, hot aisle containment involves containing the hot air exhaust from server racks to prevent it from mixing with the cool air, thereby reducing cooling costs. Both types of thermal containment systems help optimize airflow and improve energy efficiency in data centers.</p></p>
