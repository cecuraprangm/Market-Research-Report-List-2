<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petroleum Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Gathering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The petroleum pipeline infrastructure market can be divided into two main types: transmission and gathering. Transmission pipelines are large-diameter pipelines that transport refined petroleum products over long distances, often across states or even countries. These pipelines are crucial for connecting refineries to distribution centers. On the other hand, gathering pipelines are smaller pipelines that collect crude oil and natural gas from multiple wells and transport them to processing facilities. Both types of pipelines play a vital role in the efficient and safe transportation of petroleum products.</p></p>
