<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Frequency Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Radio Frequency Dryer</li><li>Intermittent Radio Frequency Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radio Frequency Dryers are commonly classified into two types: Continuous and Intermittent. Continuous Radio Frequency Dryers operate continuously, meaning materials are fed in one end and dried continuously as they move through the machine. On the other hand, Intermittent Radio Frequency Dryers operate in batches, where materials are loaded, dried, and then unloaded before the next batch is processed. Both types offer efficient and effective drying solutions for a variety of industries.</p></p>
